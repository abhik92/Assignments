\begin{questions}
\question[10]
Recall
\[ K = \{ x~|~M_x \text{ halts on } x\}\] Prove the following.
\begin{parts}
\part $K$ is {\sc SD}-complete.
\part Let $K^X = \{ x~|~ M_x^X \text{ is an oracle TM with oracle $X$ 
and $M_x^X$ halts on $x$} \}$. Show that $K^K$ is $\Sigma_2$-complete. 
\end{parts}

\question[10] A set $P$ is \textit{partially productive} if there is a partial recursive function(i.e. computed by a Turing machine $N$ - which need not be total) $\psi$ called the {\em productive function} such that:
\[ \forall x ~~\left( \mathcal{W}_x \subseteq P \implies N \textrm{ halts on $x$ } 
\&~~\psi(x) \in P \setminus \mathcal{W}_x \right) \]
Show that any productive set $P$ has an injective recursive productive function. \\ (Hint : First prove that it can be made recursive and then attempt on making it injective).

\question[5]
Prove that there must exist a recursive function such that $\{ \W_{f(n)} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ consists of precisely decidable sets.

\question[5]
A simple set is {\em effectively simple} if there is a recursive function $f$ such that:
\[ \forall n\in \mathbb{N} : \W_n \subseteq \overline{A} \implies |\W_n| \le f(n) \]
Show that Post's simple set is effectively simple. \\[2mm]
(Extra Credit) If a set $A$ is effectively simple, argue that $K \le_T A$. This justifies why Friedberg-Muchnik had to do a different construction. 
(Hint: Normal homework rules does not apply to this question. You can look up anywhere, but cite your sources. !).

\question[10]
Consider the following computational problems :
\begin{parts}
\part Given a Turing machine $M$, test if $L(M)$ is Productive.
\part Given a Turing machine $M$, test if $L(M)$ is Simple.
\end{parts}
Are they decidable? semi-decidable? \\[2mm]
(Extra Credit) Place them in the arithmetic hierarchy.
